<strong style="font-size:25px">Amazon Data Scraped with BeautifulSoup </strong></br>

<b>Project Description:</b> </br>

URL: https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=dslr+camera&i=black-friday </br>

Scraped product information from multiple pages on the Amazon website, including product names and ratings.

This is a JavaScript-rendered website. To parse this web page using <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong> in Python, I use the <strong>requests_html</strong> library along with BeautifulSoup.
The requests_html library allows me to render the JavaScript on a web page before parsing it with BeautifulSoup.
